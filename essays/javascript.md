314 has been a very different class thus far. From being almost entirely taught through the web, to the wide array of unconventional assignments, it has been an interesting two weeks. However, I think it’s a fresh change from the normal structure of computer science classes. The different style keeps you on your toes. The WOD’s are different from quizzes, being more like practice than test questions. I think writing out the WOD’s on a computer rather than on paper is a welcome change, as writing out code on paper is one of the most frustrating things known to man. 

I took a fairly extensive class on Javascript, so I didn’t learn a whole lot, but I did learn a few things so far. I had no idea that the “let” keyword was a thing. While I don’t completely see why it’s essential to use, I do see it’s place, as the more you limit scope the cleaner things tend to be. I also did not know that the for( of ) loop was a thing, that’s a small distinction which while hard to remember, will prove to be helpful down the line. 

I do enjoy working in Javascript, so I’m glad that 314 is being taught as opposed to C or Java, which I enjoy much less. Given the material of the class, it does seem like Java would be more geared towards collaborative development, but as I have only used Javascript for developing web applications, I look forward to be proven wrong.
