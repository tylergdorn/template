Smart questions are possibly one of the most important things in this modern information age. A smart question, in addition to making it seem like you know what you’re doing (which is important) helps you get the information you need, in the least amount of time. The thing one must be careful about is that most questions will seem smart to the person making the questions, because they understand exactly what they mean. However, others aren’t so fortunate, given that nobody has come up with telepathy yet. I found two questions on stack exchange which exemplify this point.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it asks a question with a good summary of a title, the body is as long as it needs be, and asks a clear question. Even people with little to no knowledge of programming could understand, loosely, what it is the question is asking. Not only that, it also asks a question which people are interested in trying to answer and expound upon. The amount of answers to the question are staggering, due to its interesting premise. It also has near perfect grammar, spelling, and capitalization.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46048182/import-the-sql-files-to-another-mysql-database-via-a-laravel-5-4 lays on the other side of the spectrum. I personally have no idea what the question is asking, and the title is a mess. What does “[on hold]” mean in this context? I can only hope to know. The question is probably not written by a native English speaker, which adds to the confusion, as the question is neigh incomprehensible. The question asker’s responses to those asking for clarification are also not helpful, being broken sentences.
