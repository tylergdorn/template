Software engineering is interesting to me because there is so much that can be solved while working on software. A lot of software engineering seems to be something akin to a puzzle to be figured out. For me, that’s the most exciting part, being able to sit down and look at a puzzle, and come back to it and think it through.  As for interests, I enjoy being able to think about how to set up the application on a very high level. It requires a lot of foresight, and is one of the harder things to do well.

At the end of ICS 314, I hope to be more skilled at not only being able to effectively communicate my ideas but also to work better in teams in general. As a computer science student, you spend a lot of your time doing solitary projects, and only speaking to others when you need help, or when you must speak to your teacher. Along the same vein, I hope to form a good group of friends in the class, who would be around me for the rest of my computer science career, who I can turn to when I need help, both in and outside the classroom. Being a transfer student as of this year, this is a little more important to me than it may be to others.

More strictly technically speaking, I think making clear and concise code would be what I would like to get out of the course. As my code stands now, I think my code is somewhat concise, but lacks in clarity, as left to my own devices (e.g. without strict requirements from professors) I tend to make nondescript variables and don’t comment that well. Another goal I have is to go from coding for now to coding for the future, in that I would make smarter decisions about projects.
