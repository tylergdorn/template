Especially among those learning to code, style guides can often be a sore point. For many students, they often have their own view of what is objectively good in terms of what composes "good" style. On the other side, a lot of style designers have their own views of what makes style good.
I'm not sure that there is an objectively good style, being such an arbitrary construct.

Speaking in terms of myself, I don't enjoy AirBnB's style guide. I don't enjoy there being spaces between if/while/etc, the condition, and then another space after the condition. I am also not a fan of putting "} else {" all on one line.
As a result I can't say i'm enjoying coding to that standard, I feel like I'm hitting space bar every two seconds trying to put enough spaces everywhere for no reason.
I think some of AirBnB's style is good however, it is just those issues that I take issue with.

All in all though, I didn't have too much issues following style. Following style is one of those things which is very important to learn, and we maybe don't follow enough at UH Manoa. Having taken a few classes where you have to strictly follow style, it hasn't been an issue at all.
Having something that goes through and tests your style on the fly is extremely nice. When I went to school at UW, we had to look through our Java code for any style errors, as they would be extremely taxing on one's grade. The addition of ESLint makes it far easier to check for style issues. It makes the whole ordeal really nice, compared to looking through all your code manually and trying to see where style might be off.
