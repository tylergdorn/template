Especially among those learning to code, style guides can often be a sore point. 
For many students, they often have their own view of what is objectively good in terms of what composes "good" style. On the other side, a lot of style designers have their own views of what makes style good.
I'm not sure that there is an objectively good style, being such an arbitrary construct. Speaking in terms of myself, I don't enjoy AirBnB's style guide. 
I don't enjoy there being spaces between if/while/etc, the condition, and then another space after the condition. I am also not a fan of putting } else { all on one line.
As a result I can't say i'm enjoying coding to that standard, I feel like I'm hitting space bar every two seconds trying to put enough spaces everywhere for no reason.
I think some of AirBnB's style is good however, it is just those issues that I take issue with.
