Google, in making it's Street View software, both intentionally and unintentionally infringed on the privacy of the general public. In having street view vans drive by and indiscriminately collect information, it clearly acted against the privacy of the general public. While they did include an opt-out system, it required one to open up their router settings and change the name. This demonstrated clearly that google wasn't interested in the privacy of the public, as most people would not know how to change the name of their wifi router, much less be aware of the issue or of an opt-out system. These policies by Google demonstrated their wanton abandon for privacy, which knowing the nature of ad companies does not come as a shock.

In doing this, they violated ACM's code of ethic 1.7 which requests that software engineers respect the privacy of others. In their policy of war driving while taking pictures, they clearly did not respect the general public's privacy, and as a result they were fined in many places. It would perhaps be another matter if users had agreed to have google take pictures of their neighborhood, but this was not the case.

A way Google could have minimized impact to the public with its street view project, and did, was to blur people's faces and license plates. In doing this it makes people anonymous and prevents people from recognizing them in suspect locations on street view.

Google can proceed with a more privacy oriented approach to software, and have a group of people overlook products to see if they are ethical or not.
