Meteor is challenging at times, but it is exciting, and will become more and more interesting to me as I continue to learn about it and become better at using the framework. There is a lot you can do and a lot of things you can change. The fact that I can write (almost) the entire thing in JavaScript is a lot of fun, as the traditional model of making web applications would involve at the very least both JavaScript and PHP, as well as likely SQL. With meteor, (excluding things such as blaze and HTML) you only use Javascript! This allows for a bit more interplay. With PHP and SQL you had to open a PHP object, and pass commands to it. 

I miss certain things about SQL in comparison to mongoDb. The syntax of mongo is a bit hard to type on a keyboard, often requiring you to press shift upwards of six times a line! This is because the syntax makes heavy use of curly brackets, making it a bit awkward to type. In comparison, the SQL syntax uses whole words, akin to how semantic ui is setup. This makes it easier to remember the commands, as well as easier to understand, save for when they get unwieldly long. 

The program organization is very cool in meteor. I enjoy the importing aspect of it, as it allows you to tell exactly what you’re using, as tedious as it can be. The hardest thing about meteor is how much you must figure out before it starts to make sense. Even after two weeks I still don’t feel like I understand meteor, although I’m slowly figuring it out.
