This is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm implemented in Java. I used mostly standard Java, save for using java.util.* 
I programmed this for a Data Structures and algorithm class at UW. In this project I programmed most of the entire thing, but the skeleton was provided.

From this project I learned a lot about how to test algorithms for errors and how to think about creating algorithms. I also learned some about data structures, as we had to use maps and lists to keep track of a map, and to iterate through it.
